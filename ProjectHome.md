a primitive ray tracer which
for the beginning
**renders only spheres** no texturing
**only reflection** only point light sources
**static super sampling (but hard shadows)** multithreaded
**static scene**

in the future
**renders triangles** 2d texturing
**might be kd-tree (not sure of it)** reflection and refraction
**point and plane light sources** dynamic super sampling
**CUDA or OpenCL** dynamic scene (moving objects and camera)
